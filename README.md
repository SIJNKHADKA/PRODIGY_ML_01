# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The goal is to provide an accurate estimation of house prices to assist homebuyers, real estate agents, and property investors in making informed decisions.

## Overview

Linear regression is a commonly used statistical technique for modeling the relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target). In this project, we use linear regression to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the linear regression model contains information about houses, including features such as:

- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Price (target variable)

You can use a sample dataset provided with this repository or obtain a similar dataset from real estate databases or online platforms.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running and viewing the notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using pip:


## Usage

1. Clone this repository:


2. Navigate to the project directory:




3. Prepare or load the house price dataset and preprocess it as necessary.

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook `house_price_prediction.ipynb` to train the linear regression model and analyze the results.

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

After training the linear regression model, you can expect to see results such as:

- Coefficients of the model
- Performance metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared) on the test set
- Visualization of predicted house prices vs. actual prices
